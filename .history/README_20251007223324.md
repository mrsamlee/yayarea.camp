## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── .github/workflows/campsite-search.yml  # GitHub Actions workflow
├── index.html                            # Beautiful web interface
├── new_main.py                          # Main search script
├── campsites_map.py                     # Campsite data mapping
├── requirements.txt                     # Python dependencies
└── README.md                           # This file
```

## 🔧 Configuration

You can customize the search parameters in `new_main.py`:

```python
# Search parameters (lines 271-274)
start_date = datetime.date.today() + relativedelta(days=1)
end_date = start_date + relativedelta(months=5)  # Search 5 months ahead
consecutive_nights = 2  # Look for 2 consecutive nights
weekends_only = True    # Only search for weekend availability
```

### Change Update Frequency

To change how often the search runs, edit `.github/workflows/campsite-search.yml`:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 * * * *'  # Every hour (current)
  # - cron: '0 */2 * * *'  # Every 2 hours
  # - cron: '0 6,18 * * *'  # Twice daily (6 AM and 6 PM)
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Styling
The web interface styling is in `index.html`. You can customize:
- Colors and gradients
- Layout and spacing
- Typography
- Responsive breakpoints

### Search Criteria
Modify the search logic in `new_main.py`:
- Add more campgrounds
- Change date ranges
- Adjust consecutive nights requirement
- Add filtering criteria

## 📊 How It Works

1. **GitHub Actions** runs the search script every hour
2. **Python script** searches ReserveCalifornia for available campsites
3. **Results** are saved to `results.json`
4. **GitHub Pages** serves the HTML interface
5. **JavaScript** loads and displays the results beautifully
6. **Auto-refresh** checks for new results every 5 minutes

## 🛠️ Local Development

To test locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the search (generates results.json)
python -c "from new_main import run_search_and_save; run_search_and_save()"

# Open index.html in your browser
open index.html
```

## 📈 Monitoring

### Check Workflow Status
- Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
- Green checkmarks = successful runs
- Red X = failed runs (check logs for errors)

### View Logs
- Click on any workflow run
- Click on **search-and-deploy** job
- Expand steps to see detailed logs

### Common Issues
- **Search timeout**: Reduce date range or campground count
- **Network errors**: Temporary issue, will retry next hour
- **No results**: Normal when campsites are fully booked
